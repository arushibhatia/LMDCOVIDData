It is also just an incredible stress reliever because of the synergistic nature of singing with others.,"I was in the state choir my junior year of high school. The conductor, Dr. Craig Hella Johnson, was one of the most passionate individuals I've ever met. Throughout the entire concert (in a truly magnificent music hall), I truly was on the verge of tears and had goosebumps. The entire choir was so connected with each and with the director. It was so evident just HOW present the director was. At moments he would just entirely stop conducting, close his eyes, and start dancing, and the choir went on so so so beautifully and in such a connected way. We were truly one with each other and the music that night. I have so many memories I could talk about here witnessing audience members in small concerts being moved to tears--and in turn, me being moved to tears--but that one sticks out to me the most. I'll never forget it. ","To be honest, I'm not sure how this question varies from the previous one, so I'll just tell another memory. One time, my choir was singing at a nursing home, and we were about to sing ""Silent Night"" in German, and one of the nursing assistants at the facility pointed out to one of the residents that she spoke German.

Out of my core friend group in high school, I am actually the only one who isn't majoring in a music-related field (e.g. Voice performance, musical theatre, music engineering). Sharing such special memories and experiences with my best friends has truly brought us all closer and given us such a strong love I have struggled to find again. Some of my best memories with them are just casually hanging out and jamming out together. Some of them were in jazz band and introduced me to jazz; now it's my absolute favorite types of music.

Taiwan- 1 month every 2 years for the first 14 years of my life
Germany-1 month",Mandarin Chinese,Taiwan,"My family uses English and Mandarin Chinese to communicate with me. When they are asking me to do something (ex. wash the dishes, take the dog out, etc.), they often use Chinese. If I initiate a conversation in English (which I often do), they will oftentimes answer back in English. ","My first language is English. It is the dominant language spoken in the house nowadays. My second language is Mandarin Chinese. When I was younger, it was spoken more frequently in the house as my parents pushed me to learn it. My parents still speak to me in Chinese, but I normally speak back in English unless I am able to easily communicate my idea in Chinese. My third language is German. My mother is a German teacher and has exposed my brother and me to the German language and culture at a young age through television shows and small tangents about German words and/or aspects of the culture. Furthermore, my childhood baby sitter (my mother's former graduate school professor) is German and would often incorporate German words into our every day lives and conversations (ex. komisch, die Hose, der Wahnsinn, die Schlange). She lived in our house for the first few years of my life and lived in the same city for longer (until she moved to Texas and now Germany). She is considered an integral part of our family. Now that I am trying to improve my German, we email every day in German and talk about what is happening in our lives. ","English is the primary language used in my community. Sometimes when I interact with my friends from Chinese backgrounds, we will also use Chinese. I am also exposed to Chinese when I visit my father's workplace (Nan Ya Plastics, a Taiwanese-based plastic company). However, this exposure is minimum. Lastly, I am mostly exposed to German in my community through classes. i am rarely exposed to German outside of academic classes unless I actively seek it or through my mother and/or my babysitter. ","When visiting my grandparents in Taiwan, I am often completely immersed in the language (Mandarin Chinese) because my grandparents and other extended family members are not very proficient in English. My only exposure to English in this environment is through my brother, mother, and father. During my time studying abroad in Germany, I was completely immersed in the culture and language and was not allowed to speak German during my time there. ",Germany and Taiwan,"In the summer, my mother and I were planning on visiting Germany and Taiwan. I was going to use this opportunity to further improve my proficiency in both German and Mandarin Chinese, but because of COVID-19, I was unable to do so. Furthermore, learning German through Zoom during my first semester of college seems vastly different as I am always on mute so pronunciation exercises are kept at a minimum. ",Negative,Negative,Negative,,Negative,"COVID-19 has hindered my opportunity for language acquisition due to travel restrictions. However, from this extra time that quarantine has provided, I have also used this extra time to review German skills (grammar rules, reading skills, speaking skills, etc.) and watch the German news. Furthermore, as a student, I am lacking the typical instant feedback and connection in a physical classroom as is happening with almost all other virtual classes.
